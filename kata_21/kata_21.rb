# Implementation of Kata 21
# 1. A singly linked list (each node has a reference to the next node).
# 2. A doubly linked list (each node has a reference to both the next and previous nodes).
# 3. Some other implementation of your choosing, except that it should use no references 
# 		(pointers) to collect nodes together in the list.
